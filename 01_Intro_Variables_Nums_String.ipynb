    "# Variables, Numbers and Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variables\n",
    "Python programs use variables to store values. A *variable* is assigned a value such as a number or a string. Moreover, Assigning a value to an existing variable replaces the previously\n",
    "stored value. Please note that the assignment operator `=` does not denote mathematical equality.\n",
    "\n",
    "A variable must be created and initialized before it can be used for the first time. For example,\n",
    "the following sequence of statements would not be legal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "canVolume = 12 * literPerOunce # Error: literPerOunce has not yet been created.\n",
    "literPerOunce = 0.0296\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In your program, the statements are executed in order. When the first statement is executed by\n",
    "the virtual machine, it does not know that literPerOunce will be created in the next line, and it\n",
    "reports an “undefined name” error. The remedy is to reorder the statements so that each vari-\n",
    "able is created and initialized before it is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Number types\n",
    "The data type of a value specifies how the value is stored in the computer and what operations can be performed on the value. A data type provided by the language itself is called a **primitive** data type. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, there are several different types of numbers. An _*integer*_ value is a whole number without a fractional part. _*Floating-point*_ numbers contain a fractional part.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "taxRate = 5     # Integer\n",
    "taxRate = 5.5   # Floating Point\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Some things to note: \n",
    "- Integers can be negative\n",
    "- Zero is an integer\n",
    "- A number in exponential notations such as $1 \\times 10^6$ or 1000000 always has type `float`\n",
    "\n",
    "--- \n",
    "### Variable Names\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Names must start with a *letter* or the *underscore* (_) character, and the remaining characters must be letters, numbers, or underscores.\n",
    "2. You cannot use other symbols such as ? or %. Spaces are not permitted inside names either. You can use uppercase letters to denote word bound­aries, as in cansPerPack. This naming convention is called camel\n",
    "case because the uppercase letters in the middle of the name look like the humps of a camel.\n",
    "3. Variable names are case sensitive\n",
    "4. Variable names cannot start with a number.\n",
    "5. Variable names cannot contain spaces.\n",
    "6. You cannot use a reserved word as a variable name such as `if` or `class` as names; these words are\n",
    "reserved exclusively for their special Python meanings.\n",
    "7. You cannot use symbols such as / or.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Constants\n",
    "\n",
    "A constant variable, or simply a constant, is a variable whose value should not be changed after it has been assigned an initial value. Some languages provide an explicit mechanism for marking a variable as a constant and will generate a syntax error if you attempt to assign a new value to the variable. Python leaves it to the programmer to make sure that constants are not changed. Thus, it is common practice to specify a constant variable with the use of all capital letters for its name.\n",
    "`BOTTLE_VOLUME = 2.0`\n",
    "`MAX_SIZE = 100`\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Arithmetic\n",
    "\n",
    "As in regular algebraic notation, multi­plication and division have a higher precedence than addition and subtraction. For example, in the expres­sion `a + b / 2`, the `/` is carried out first, even though the + operation occurs further to the left. Again, as in algebra, operators with the same precedence are executed left-to-right. For example, 10 - 2 - 3 is 8 – 3 or 5. Mixing integers and floating-point values in an arithmetic expression yields a floating-point value. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Powers\n",
    "Python uses the exponential operator ** to denote the power operation. For example, the Python equivalent of the mathematical expression $a^2$ is `a ** 2`. Note that there can be no space between the two asterisks. As in mathematics, the exponential operator has a higher order of precedence than the other arithmetic operators. For example, 10 * 2 ** 3 is $10 \\times 2^3 = 80$. Unlike the other arithmetic operators, power operators are evaluated from right to left. Thus, the Python expression `10 ** 2 ** 3` is equivalent to $$10^{(2^3)} = 10^8 = 100{,}000{,}000.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In algebra, you use fractions and exponents to arrange expressions in a compact two-dimensional form. In Python, you have to write all expressions in a linear arrangement. For example, the mathematical expression\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "b \\times \\left( 1 + \\frac{r}{100} \\right)^n\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "becomes `b * (1 + r / 100) ** n`\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Floor Division and Remainder\n",
    "When you divide two integers with the `/` operator, you get a floating-point value. However, we can also perform **floor division** using the `//` operator to return an integer value. Take `7 / 4` which equals 1.75. The `//` operator makes the expression `1` as it keeps the integer answer and discards the fractional component of the answer. If you also want to utilize the remainder, you can do so with the modulo operator `%` which deals with the **integer remainder** of a division operation rather than the fractional remainder (0.75). It follows the mathematical formula \n",
    "\n",

    "2. **Methods**:\n",
    "   - Methods are functions that belong to an object and can perform specific actions or transformations on it.\n",
    "   - The dot (`.`) is used to call a method on an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **The Syntax**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   object.method(arguments)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `object`: The variable (or literal) on which you want to apply the method.\n",
    "   - `method`: The function associated with the object’s class.\n",
    "   - `arguments`: Optional input values the method may require.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Using Dot Notation**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "message = \"Hello World\"\n",
    "lowercase_message = message.lower()\n",
    "print(lowercase_message)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step-by-Step Explanation:\n",
    "1. **Object Creation**:\n",
    "   - The variable `message` is assigned the value `\"Hello World\"`, which is a string object (`str` class).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Method Call**:\n",
    "   - `message.lower()` uses dot notation to call the `lower()` method of the `str` class.\n",
    "   - The `lower()` method is a built-in function of the `str` class, and its purpose is to convert all uppercase letters in the string to lowercase.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Output**:\n",
    "   - The result of `message.lower()` is a new string (`\"hello world\"`), which is stored in the variable `lowercase_message`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Points about Dot Notation**:\n",
    "1. **String Methods**:\n",
    "   - Python strings have many methods (e.g., `upper()`, `strip()`, `replace()`, etc.) that you can call using dot notation.\n",
    "   - Each method is designed to operate specifically on string objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Immutability**:\n",
    "   - Strings are **immutable** in Python, meaning the original string (`message`) is not modified. Instead, the method returns a new string.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Chainable**:\n",
    "   - Dot notation allows **method chaining**, where multiple methods can be applied in a single line:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     message = \"  Hello World  \"\n",
    "     cleaned_message = message.strip().lower()\n",
    "     print(cleaned_message)  # Output: \"hello world\"\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - Here, `strip()` removes whitespace, and `lower()` converts the result to lowercase.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How to Explain Dot Notation Simply**\n",
    "- **Analogy**: Think of the dot (`.`) as a door. You’re asking the object to “open the door” to its methods or properties.\n",
    "- **In Action**:\n",
    "   - **Object**: The variable or data you’re working with (e.g., `\"Hello World\"`).\n",
    "   - **Method**: A predefined tool (e.g., `lower()`) that does something specific with the object.\n"

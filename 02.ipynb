    "A list is a container that stores a sequence of values. A list is created using square brackets `[]` and items are stored in the order they are provided. You will want to store the list in a variable so that you can access it later. \n",
    "\n",
    "In a list's sequence of elements, each value has an integer position or index. To access a list element, you specify which index you want to use. That is done with the subscript operator `[]` in the same way that you access individual characters in a string. Each individual element in a list is accessed by an integer i, using the notation `list[i]`.\n",

    "Take the `values` variable above, if you wanted to add to values by using `values[3] = 91` you would get an **out-of-range** error. Trying to access an element that does not exist in the current list is a serious error. For example, if values has ten elements, you are not allowed to access values[20].\n",

    "index values and look up each element, or you can loop over the elements themselves. \n",

    "### Slicing with Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables storing lists do not hold the actual elements but rather a reference to the memory location where the list is stored. When you assign one list variable to another (e.g., values = scores), both variables refer to the same list. This makes the second variable an alias for the first. Therefore, modifying the list using one variable affects the list referenced by the other variable.To create a copy of the list and avoid shared references, you can use methods like:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Slicing: `values = scores[:]`\n",
    "    - Slicing creates a shallow copy of the list by iterating through the original list and copying its elements into a new list.\n",
    "    - The new list is stored in a different memory location, so changes to one list won't affect the other.\n",
    "    - This method only works for a shallow copy, meaning that if the list contains other mutable objects (e.g., nested lists), the nested objects will still be shared by reference.\n",
    "    - A shallow copy only duplicates the top-level elements of a list. If one of the elements is a mutable object, like another list, the shallow copy will still reference the same memory location for that nested object. This means changes to the nested object through one variable will reflect in the other because they both share a reference to the same nested object.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `list()` Constructor: `values = list(scores)`\n",
    "    - The `list()` constructor iterates over the input iterable (the original list) and creates a new list object.\n",
    "    - Like slicing, this creates a shallow copy, so the top-level elements are copied, but nested mutable objects are still shared.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. copy Module:\n",
    "    - Shallow copy: Similar to slicing and the list() constructor, this method creates a new list for the top-level elements but keeps references to any nested mutable objects.\n",
    "    - Deep copy: Goes one step further - it recursively copies all objects within the list, including nested mutable objects, ensuring that no references are shared between the original and copied lists.\n",
    "    - This is particularly useful for copying complex data structures with multiple levels of nested lists or dictionaries.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "        import copy\n",
    "        values = copy.copy(scores)      # Shallow copy\n",
    "        values = copy.deepcopy(scores)  # Deep copy for nested lists\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "Slicing allows you to extract a portion (or \"slice\") of a list using the syntax:\n",
    "`list[start:end:step]`. \n",
    "- `start` is inclusive and defaults to 0 if no value is given\n",
    "- `end` is exclusive and defaults to the length of the list if omitted\n",
    "- `step` is the interval between elements in the slice and defaults to 1 if omitted. Use a negative step to reverse.\n",

But if we don't know what initial values, we can create an empty list or add values to end of a list using the `append()` method with the syntax: `list.append(item)`.

It's syntax: `list.insert(index, item)`\n",

    "If you simply want to know whether an element is present in a list, use the `in` operator which tests\n",
    "whether an element is contained in a list. Moreover, you can retrieve the integer of the first-matching index value of an element in the list with the `index()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you call the index method, the element to be found must be in the list or a run-time exception occurs. It is usually a good idea to test with the in operator before calling the index method. \n",

    "friends = [\"Harry\", \"Emily\", \"Bob\", \"Cari\", \"Emily\"]\n",

    "You can remove values from a list using\n",
    "- The `pop()` method removes an element at a given position. \n",
    "    - To remove the element at index position 1, use the command `list.pop(1)` \n",
    "    - All of the elements following the removed element are moved up one position to close the gap. The size of the `list` is reduced by 1 (see Figure 5). The index passed to the pop method must be within the valid range.\n",
    "    - Use to remove an element from any position in the list\n",
    "    - The element removed from the list is returned by the pop method. This allows you to combine two operations in oneâ€”accessing the element and removing it: `print(\"The removed item is\", list.pop(1))`\n",
    "- The `remove()` method removes an element by *value* instead of by *position*. So if you know a value is in a list but don't know its position: \n",
    "    - `friends.remove(\"Cari\")`\n",
    "    - Note that the value being removed must be in the list or an exception is raised. To avoid a run-time error, you should first verify that the element is in the list before attempting to remove it\n",

    "### Concatenating lists\n",
    "Two lists can be concatenated using the plus `(+)` operator. The concatenation of two lists is a new list that contains the elements of the first list, followed by the elements of the second. For example, suppose we have two lists and we want to create a new list that combines the two: \n",

    "```\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Equality Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the `==` operator to compare whether two lists have the same elements, in the same order. For example, `[1, 4, 9] == [1, 4, 9]` is `True`, but `[1, 4, 9 ] == [4, 1, 9]` is `False`. The opposite of `==` is `!=`. The expression `[1, 4, 9] != [4, 9]` is `True`.\n",

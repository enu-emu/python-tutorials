    "\n",
    "1. Once the script is in the same directory as the module, use the following key words to import the module: \n",
    "    - `import my_module`\n",
    "    - Running the script executes all code in the module (e.g. print statement)\n",
    "2. Access the function or variable with the following syntax: \n",
    "    - `my_module.function_name()`\n",
    "    - `my_module.variable_name`\n",
    "3. You can use an alias instead of the actual names with the following syntax: \n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    import my_module as mm\n",
    "    index = mm.find_index(courses, \"Math\")\n",

    "    ```python\n",
    "    from my_module import find_index, test\n",
    "    index = find_index(courses, \"Math\") # Didn't need my_module or mm prefix\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "5. You can import everything with `from my_module import *` however, it is not recommended because it becomes unclear which module defines specific functions/variables.\n"
